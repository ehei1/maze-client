It make random maze. You can walk through path.

But...

I used code repository on Naver Developer Portal. But it was closed.

Therefore I lost my code and resources. Fortunately I found source on my GameJob's porpolio section.

This is so complicated by many dependancies(CEGUI, boost, Newton, Ogre, OgreNewt...). I spent some days to compile it and succeed. But I couldn't run. I couldn't restore resource anyway.
